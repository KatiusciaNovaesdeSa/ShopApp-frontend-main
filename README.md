# ShoppingCart

Project Description:
We designed an online Book store. It allows Customers to sigup, login, logout, reset their password, search items by category, add items to cart, update or delete items from cart and checkout. 
In the about us page, we can add new team members and store their images on S3 bucket. 

Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data 
- Angular 
- Java Mail
- Mockito 
- Log4
- JWT Token
- S3 bucket for images storage
- Ec2 hosting for backend.


List of features ready and TODOs for future development:

- All users register would receive a confirmation email to their email address.
- All users must login to buy books and can log out after they finish ordering.
- Users can choose books by book genres.
- The add to cart feature helps buyers keep track of their order and see the book title and quantities.
- Buyers can place orders directly and after placing the order, the cart is emptied.
- When buyers log out, the cart is still intact.
- The backend application is hosted in AWS EC2.

To-do list:

- Users can sell their own books with image uploading feature.
- Passwords should be encrypted.
